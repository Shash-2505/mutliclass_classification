# Introduction
Multiclass classification has a set of steps such as preprocessing, data encoding, train, and prediction that are always repeated.

This repository has a notebook which has functions to train a classification model using Random Forest, SVM, and LightGBM algorithms. The models are compared for an Obesity risk prediction problem on Kaggle.

# Additional information
A poetry environment is required to be set up to run the notebook.
